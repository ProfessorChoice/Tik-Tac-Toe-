Tic-Tac-Toe AI

Overview
This is a simple Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game featuring an AI opponent that plays optimally using the **Minimax algorithm**. The project demonstrates concepts from classical artificial intelligence, such as adversarial search and decision trees.

Features
- Play Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI that never loses.
- Command-line interface for easy play.
- Clean, well-commented Python code for learning and demonstration.

How It Works
The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm**, which:
- Recursively explores all possible moves.
- Evaluates the best possible outcome for both the player and the opponent.
- Chooses the move that minimizes the possible loss for the worst-case scenario.

This ensures the AI always plays the best possible move given the current game state.
